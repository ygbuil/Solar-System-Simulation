# Solar-System-Simulation
2D physics simulation of the solar system.

Provided the initial conditions for all planets (mass, position and velocity), the simulation evolves following the law gravitational attraction:
$$ {G*m_1*m_2 \over r**2} $$
$$ {\sqrt{2}} $$

The initial conditions can be changed and you can experiment how would the system evolve
