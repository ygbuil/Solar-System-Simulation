# Solar-System-Simulation
2D physics simulation of the solar system.

Provided the initial conditions for all planets (mass, position and velocity), the simulation evolves following the law gravitational attraction:
$$ {G*m_1*m_2 \over r**2} $$
$$
{\sqrt{2}}
$$
![\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}]

The initial conditions can be changed and you can experiment how would the system evolve
