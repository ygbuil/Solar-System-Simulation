# Solar-System-Simulation
2D physics simulation of the solar system.

Provided the initial conditions for all planets (mass, position and velocity), the simulation evolves following the Netwon's law of Universal Gravitational:

The initial conditions can be changed and you can experiment how would the system evolve
